    <p class="text-muted mb-4">
      I help students build strong foundations in Python programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science.
      My teaching style blends clear explanations, hands-on coding, and real-world applications so that you not only
      learn concepts but also understand how to apply them in projects and problem-solving scenarios.

          <p class="mb-0">
            My approach is to make learning Python for AI & Data Science simple, structured, and engaging. 
            Every session includes theory, coding exercises, and discussions on real-world use cases. 
            Students work on mini-projects and weekly assessments to strengthen problem-solving skills 
            and gain confidence for academic exams as well as practical usage of their skills.
